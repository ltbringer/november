I have loved Pokemon since a I was a 13 year old child. Charizard was my favorite Pokemon at the time.
Limited access to TV and friends, my escape was this fantasy world where I could befriend these creatures.
A world where dragons were as real as ghosts. The anime series could only feed me so much and in time I started looking.
Discovered the official pokemon.com website, the pokedex, events and what not but none of it available to my country.
At that age, I was used to it but I kept looking and I heard about a GBC game called pokemon crystal.

I tried hard to find it, and all I got was a copy in Spanish. Nevertheless the 8-bit intro music still brings peace to me.
I barely understood the dialog of the game but that didn't stop me from playing. The joy of getting my own pokemon (I picked Typhlosion),
and running into the grass to battle a hoot hoot was the best thing ever for my 13 year old self. I departed from the series after Pokemon Black and White.
Life got busy and childhood needed to rest. 

Years later, I still remember that game for its simplicity. Children my age had access to games that won't run on my computer, yet I wasn't settling.
The pixelated graphics, simple art style, no _seemingly_ real interactions but all that meant nothing in front of hours of exploring cities, defeating
team rocket, training pokemon and grinding till they would evolve to their final forms. It had no substitute. I tried to play the old games
and realized I didn't like a few things after all. I didn't like the battle scene, I didn't like the lack of interaction with the environment.

1. You could cycle but that's like walking 2-4x faster.
2. You could using fishing rods but it was all about timing the "A" button.
3. You could use surf and dive in water. Honestly diving was a refresher. Underwater caves and explorations in Pokemon Emerald were breathtaking.
4. You could use various pokeballs to catch pokemon but arbitrary probability would lead to capture.
5. The most exciting battle scene felt like pictures. No movement, No reaction to damage, while there was an attack animation it just felt like
    a special effect translated from a point to another.
6. Rare pokemon were limited to events.
7. Trading required custom hardware. Although things have changed now. Its a smaller world with a wifi connection.

At my age, I think it is a good way to pay respect to the devs that gave me a hopeful childhood,
by trying to extend the idea and see for myself if my expectations make sense for a role playing game.

## Game Design

WIP. 

- The Main Character (MC) can explore an open world map. I am starting with a static image but want to learn building dynamic maps.
- There are hostile monsters that can attack the MC.
- There are curious/friendly monsters that can join the MC in their journey.
- Battling monsters generates gold (in-game currency).
- The map can generate items that can be collected.
- Living things have a healing factor (which can be reduced).
